# Wisdom #

[Wisdom](https://github.com/AurelioDeRosa/wisdom) is a collection of quotes, facts, and statistics from top-notch developers, designers, entrepreneurs, and many more. The aim of this repository is to gather notions that can be of interest and inspiration for everyone, in addition to be useful for speakers that want to add relevant wisdom in their presentations.

For each of the wisdom collected, where available, you'll find the author(s), some tags that will help you in identifying those of interest for you, and a reference to the source.

This repository wants to be a community effort, so feel free to [contribute](#contribute).

## Contribute ##

Everyone is invited to contribute to [Wisdom](https://github.com/AurelioDeRosa/wisdom) and any contribution to improve this project is highly appreciated. To add a quote, fact, or statistic, create a pull request adhering to [the format specified](#format).

### Format ###

The format adopted in this repository is very simple. Every wisdom is marked as a blockquote with the author in the next line. Then, there is an an empty new line. Finally, you can place some tags and a reference. To have the reference on a new line, I used the two-spaces trick (place two spaces at the end of the line).

An example of the code used is shown below:

```
> "Place the quote here."
— Author(s) fullname

Tags: tag1, tag2, tag3  
Reference: http://URL-to-the-reference
```
